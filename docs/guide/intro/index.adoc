## Introduction

The Wildfly jar maven plugin is aimed to build a bootable jar for WildFly (starting version 20.0.0.Final). 
A WildFly bootable jar contains both the server and your packaged application (a jar, a ear or a war).
Once the application has been built and packaged as a bootable jar, you can start the application using the following command:

```
java -jar target/myapp-wildfly.jar
```

To get the list of the startup arguments:

```
java -jar target/myapp-wildfly.jar --help
```

A WildFly bootable jar behave in a way that is similar to a WildFly server installed on file system:

* It supports the main standalone server startup arguments. 
* It can be administered/monitored using JBoss CLI.


Some limitations exist:

* The server can't be re-started automatically during a shutdown. The bootable jar process will exit without restarting.
* Management model changes (eg: using JBoss CLI) are not persisted. Once the server is killed, management updates are lost.
* Security manager can't be enabled using the _-secmgr_ argument. All permissions must be granted to the bootable jar codebase. 
(The example https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/secmanager[secmanager] covers security manager usage).
* Server can't be started in admin mode.

NB: When started, the bootable jar installs a WildFly server in the _TEMP_ directory. The bootable jar displayed traces contain the actual path to this transient installation. This 
installation is deleted when the bootable jar process exits.

## Examples

The directory https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples[examples] 
contains maven example projects that highlight various usages of the WildFly bootable jar. Build and run these projects
to familiarize yourself with the maven plugin. A good example to start with is the 
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/jaxrs[jaxrs] example.

Some of these examples are targeting deployment of the bootable jar in OpenShift. 
For example: https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/mp-config[mp-config] and https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/postgresql[postgresql].

Deployment inside a https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[JIB] container is 
covered by https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/jib[jib] example and _examples/jib-*_ projects.

## Composing custom server with Galleon layers

When building a bootable jar you have the ability to select the set of https://docs.wildfly.org/19.1/Admin_Guide.html#defined-galleon-layers[WildFly server Galleon layers] 
you want to see present in the bootable jar. Selecting a subset of server features has an impact on the server xml configuration 
and the set of installed JBoss modules. By selecting the subset required by your application you will reduce the jar size, server configuration content and memory footprint.

You are not limited to the https://docs.wildfly.org/19.1/Admin_Guide.html#defined-galleon-layers[WildFly defined Galleon layers], you can combine other third parties Galleon Layers compatible with 
WildFly (eg: https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack[Wildfly database drivers and datasources layers]). 
The example https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/postgresql[postgresql] 
shows how to create a _cloud-server_ with support for _postgresql_ database.

### Specifying the WildFly server version to use

You need to provide a reference to the WildFly Galleon producer that contains the layers you want to use. This can be done in 3 ways.

#### Providing WildFly Galleon feature-pack location

That is the simplest way to reference a WildFly server. 
The configuration element link:#featurePackLocation[feature-pack-location] contains this information.

Some examples:

* To provision a WildFly 20 server: 

```
<feature-pack-location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#20.0.0.Final</feature-pack-location>
```

* To provision the latest WildFly server: 

```
<feature-pack-location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)</feature-pack-location>
```

#### Providing a list of Galleon feature-packs

In some cases you will want to combine Galleon layers from multiple sources. In this case you will use the link:#featurePacks[feature-packs] configuration element that contains a list 
of feature-packs. For example, to provision Galleon layers from WildFly 20 and WildFly extras datasources you would provide:

```
<feature-packs>
    <feature-pack>
        <location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#20.0.0.Final</location>
    </feature-pack>
    <feature-pack>
        <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
        <artifactId>wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.6.Final</version>
    </feature-pack>
</feature-packs>
```

NB: The list of feature-packs can't be used in conjunction with link:#featurePackLocation[feature-pack-location] element.


#### Providing a Galleon provisioning.xml file

For advanced use cases you can fully control the Galleon provisioning by defining the file _galleon/provisioning.xml_. 
_galleon_ directory must be located in the root directory of your maven project. 


### Specifying the set of Galleon layers to use

If no Galleon layers are provided, a microprofile standalone server (with a configuration identical to the 
_standalone-microprofile.xml_ configuration) is provisioned and packaged in the bootable jar. 
In order to reduce the server content to your application needs, use the link:#layers[layers] configuration element.

For example, to provision a server containing jaxrs and management support:

```
<layers>
    <layer>jaxrs</layer>
    <layer>management</layer>
</layers>
```

### Excluding Galleon layers

In order to exclude layers that are not strictly required, use the link:#excludedLayers[excluded-layers] configuration element.

For example, _jaxrs_ layer (that depends on _web-server_ layer) brings the deployment scanner. The deployment scanner being an optional dependency of the _web-server_ layer 
it can be excluded:

```
<excluded-layers>
    <layer>deployment-scanner</layer>
</excluded-layers>
``` 

## URL context path of deployed application

By default, a war deployed inside a bootable jar is located in the root context ('/'). This can be changed to the war file name by using the link:#rootUrlPath[root-url-path] configuration element.


## Hollow bootable jar

If your use-case requires it, you can create a bootable jar that doesn't contain a deployment. It can be handy to re-use a bootable jar artifact with various deployments.
Use the link:#hollowJar[hollow-jar] configuration element to create an hollow jar.

The example https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/hollow-jar[hollow-jar] shows how to build an hollow jar.

When starting an hollow jar you can provide the path to a deployment you want to see deployed inside the server. For example:

``
 java -jar target/jaxrs-hollow-server-wildfly.jar --deployment=path/to/my-jaxrs-app.war
``

NB: In order to have your deployment be located in the root context, name the war file _ROOT.war_.

## Configuring the server during packaging

In addition to Galleon layers that you can use to configure the server, you can fine tune the server during packaging.

The maven plugin allows you to:

* Run https://docs.wildfly.org/20/Admin_Guide.html#Command_Line_Interface[WildFly CLI] scripts (see https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/logging[logging] example to configure loggers).
* Add extra content that you want to see packaged in the server (eg: _standalone/configuration/application-users.properties_, _standalone/configuration/keystore.jks_, ...).
The example https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/https[https] shows how to package a keystore file in the bootable jar.

NB: The configuration changes applied during packaging are persisted in the server configuration.

### WildFly CLI execution during packaging

Part of WildFly CLI command line tool has been integrated in the Maven plugin. The plugin supports execution of CLI script files with a limited set of CLI configuration items.

CLI script files are text files that contain a sequence of WildFly CLI commands. Commands can be CLI defined commands 
(some builtin commands allowing to achieve complex sequence of server operations) and generic management operations to be sent to the server. Some examples can
be found in WildFly administration guide https://docs.wildfly.org/20/Admin_Guide.html#CLI_Recipes[CLI recipes chapter].

In the context of Bootable JAR, the script does not need to contain commands to connect to the server or start an embedded server. 
The Maven plugin handles that for you by starting an embedded server for each group of scripts.

The plugin allows you to execute multiple group of scripts with different CLI contexts. 
A group of scripts and its configuration are defined in a ```cli-session``` composed of:

* ```<script-files>```: the list of paths to script files .
* ```properties-file```: (optional) a path to a properties file that contains java properties that scripts can reference (using the syntax ```${my.prop}```). 
For example, a command that sets the public inet-address to the value of ```all.addresses``` system property looks like: ```/interface=public:write-attribute(name=inet-address,value=${all.addresses})```
* ```resolve-expressions```: (optional) a boolean indicating if system properties or 
expressions are resolved before sending the operation requests to the server. Value is ```true``` by default.

All scripts present in a ```cli-session``` are executed within a single CLI execution. An embedded server is started for each defined ```cli-session```.

NB: The scripts are executed in the order they are defined in the plugin configuration. 

CLI configuration example:
```
<cli-sessions>
  <cli-session>
    <script-files>
        <script>../scripts/script1.cli</script>
    </script-files>
    <!-- We want the env variables to be resolved during server execution -->
    <resolve-expressions>false</resolve-expressions>
  </cli-session>
  <cli-session>
    <script-files>
        <script>../scripts/script2.cli</script>
    </script-files>
    <properties-file>../scripts/cli.properties</properties-file>
    <!-- We want the properties to be resolved during CLI execution (not actually needed, this is the default behavior) -->
    <resolve-expressions>true</resolve-expressions>
  </cli-session>
</cli-sessions>
```

## Configuring the server at runtime

The server can be configured using WildFly management tooling (JBOSS CLI, HAL web console, ...).

NB: Configuration changes are not persisted. Once the server is killed, management updates are lost.

## Other maven plugin goals

In addition the main link:#_package[package] goal used to build a bootable jar, the following goals are available:

* link:#_dev[dev]: To build a bootable jar in 'dev' mode.
* link:#_run[run]: To launch the bootable jar foreground (blocking).
* link:#_start[start]: To launch the bootable jar in background (non blocking).
* link:#_shutdown[shutdown]: To kill a running bootable jar.

Check the link:#_maven_plugin[maven plugin documentation] for an exhaustive list of configuration elements usable with each goal.

## Development mode (dev mode)

When packaging a bootable jar, a WildFly server is provisioned and customization (if any) is applied. Rebuilding a bootable jar each time is time consuming
and slows down the application development.
In order to speed-up the development of your application, the maven plugin offers a link:#_dev[dev] goal that builds and starts the bootable jar only once.

The workflow to follow during development is:

* _mvn wildfly-jar:dev_
** The plugin builds an hollow server bootable jar and starts it. The server uses the deployment scanner to monitor the _target/deployments_ directory in which 
your application will be copied during packaging.
* _mvn package -Ddev_
** Note the _-Ddev_ system property passed to the _package_ goal. This informs the plugin to skip creation of the bootable jar and to copy your application to _target/deployments_ directory. 
The running server detects the application and deploys it.
* Do changes in your application code.
* _mvn package -Ddev_
** Once your application is built, the plugin copies it to the _target/deployments_ directory. The running server detects the updated application and re-deploys it.
* When done, kill the server: _mvn wildfly-jar:shutdown_
* When you are done with your application, create the final packaging by calling: _mvn package_

NB: Although the _dev_ mode relies on the deployment scanner, you can safely exclude it from the set of layers. 
The maven plugin forces its presence when the server is started in _dev_ mode.

## Advanced usages

### Provisioning a slim bootable jar

A _slim bootable jar_ is a jar that doesn't contain JBoss modules jar files. The JBoss modules jar files are retrieved from the local maven repository.
Such slim bootable jar is much smaller and starts faster.

To enable slim bootable jar use the link:#pluginOptions[plugin-options] configuration element and add to it the _jboss-maven-dist_ element. For example:

```
<plugin-options>
    <jboss-maven-dist/>
</plugin-options>
```

When running a slim bootable jar, the default local maven repository is used to resolve JBoss modules artifacts 
(in your development environment it shouldn't require special setup to start the bootable jar).

This can be overriden by using the _-Dmaven.repo.local=<path to repository>_ when launching the server, for example:

```
java -Dmaven.repo.local=/opt/maven/maven-repo -jar jaxrs-wildfly.jar
```

#### Generating a maven local repository during packaging

The maven plugin can generate a maven repository directory containing all the JBoss modules artifacts required by the slim bootable jar. The generated maven repository allows to 
run a slim bootable jar in a context were no local maven cache is present. 

To enable slim bootable jar maven repository generation, use the link:#pluginOptions[plugin-options] configuration element and add to it the _jboss-maven-dist_ and 
_jboss-maven-repo_ elements. For example:

```
<plugin-options>
    <jboss-maven-dist/>
    <jboss-maven-repo>./my-maven-repo</jboss-maven-repo>
</plugin-options>
```

In this example, the directory _./my-maven-repo_ is created and contains the set of JBoss modules jar required to start the server.
 
The https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/master/examples/slim[slim] example shows how to build a slim bootable jar 
and generate a local maven repository used at startup.
