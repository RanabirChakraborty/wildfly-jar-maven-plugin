Each directory (except the _scripts_ directory that contains WildFly CLI scripts shared by some examples) 
contains an example that covers a specific use-case in which WildFly bootable JAR Maven plugin is used. Each directory contains a README.md file
that contains the information to build and run the example. 

NB: The released examples depend on the released plugin. In the master branch,
the examples depend on the SNAPSHOT build of the plugin.
